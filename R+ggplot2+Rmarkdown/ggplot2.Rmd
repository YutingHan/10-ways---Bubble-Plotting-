## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Read car-sample.csv file

```{r cars}
CarData<-read.csv(file = "cars-sample.csv",  header=TRUE, sep=",")
summary(CarData)
```

## Including Plots

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(CarData,aes(x=Weight,y=MPG))+geom_point(aes(color=Manufacturer,size=Weight),alpha=0.5)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
